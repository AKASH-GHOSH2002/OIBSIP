          <h2> The Braveheart of Bengal and India's Youngest Revolutionary‚Äù</h2>
          <p>
            <b></b> Khudiram Bose</b> (1889-1908) was a young Indian revolutionary who became a martyr in the struggle for independence from British rule. Born in Medinipur, Bengal, he was inspired by nationalist leaders and revolutionary literature. Khudiram joined the Anushilan Samiti, an organization committed to Indian independence through armed struggle.

            In 1908, at just 18, Khudiram and Prafulla Chaki attempted to assassinate British magistrate Kingsford in Muzaffarpur. Mistakenly targeting a carriage with the wife and daughter of a barrister instead, their bomb attack resulted in their deaths. Khudiram was captured and, after a high-profile trial, was sentenced to death. His calm and defiant demeanor during his trial and execution won him widespread admiration.
            
            Executed on August 11, 1908, Khudiram became one of the youngest martyrs in India's freedom movement. His courage and sacrifice inspired many to join the fight against colonial rule, making him a symbol of youthful rebellion and patriotism. Numerous memorials and institutions in India commemorate his legacy, honoring his contributions to the country's quest for independence.
